@RationalEtienne @lexfridman @woodhaus2 Haha
@OwenSparks_ @lexfridman I love the yoke!
@lexfridman Tesla engineering is awesome!
@TeslaNY @LVCVA People like it!
@Adamklotz_ @BryceSpaceTech Starlink missions will move to Starship
@BryceSpaceTech Useful mass to orbit is the primary figure of merit
@squawksquare @FredericLambert https://t.co/mGmRXu0gKy
@teslaownersSV Exactly
"@dogeofficialceo @MattWallace888 Now that I have made some improvements, I‚Äôm pretty sure it‚Äôs worth $69k haha"
"@MattWallace888 My primary home is literally a ~$50k house in Boca Chica / Starbase that I rent from SpaceX. It‚Äôs kinda awesome though.

Only house I own is the events house in the Bay Area. If I sold it, the house would see less use, unless bought by a big family, which might happen some day."
"@leastImAlive @PPathole Yeah, sold my houses, except for 1 in Bay Area that‚Äôs rented out for events. 

Working on sustainable energy for Earth with Tesla &amp; protecting future of consciousness by making life multiplanetary with SpaceX. Also, AI risk mitigation with Neuralink &amp; fixing traffic with Boring."
"@PPathole Exactly. Only time I sell Tesla stock is when my stock options are expiring &amp; I have no choice. 

Btw, I will continue to pay income taxes in California proportionate to my time in state, which is &amp; will be significant."

@BTCTN A new space race has begun!
@ModelYendofICE At the annual shareholder meeting! Probably late July / early August.
0 to 60mph in under 2 secs. Quickest production car ever made of any kind. Has to be felt to be believed.
"Plaid+ is canceled. No need, as Plaid is just so good."
Model S goes to Plaid speed this week

"@WholeMarsBlog One more production release of pure vision this week, then FSD beta 9 a week or two later. V9.0 FSD is also pure vision. Foundational improvements are immense."

"@WholeMarsBlog That‚Äôs where we get most of our lithium. Also, whereas phone batteries make heavy use of cobalt in cathode, Tesla uses primarily nickel, which is trickier, but has better energy density (range).

Iron cathode cells are now competitive for stationary packs &amp; mid range cars."

@teslaownersSV We went public for $3.40/share!
@PPathole @SpaceX Science-fiction should not be fiction forever!
@ErcXspace @austinbarnard45 @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight Might take a few kicks at the can before we catch the rocket haha
"@p_ferragu Our biggest challenge is supply chain, especially microcontroller chips. Never seen anything like it. 

Fear of running out is causing every company to overorder ‚Äì like the toilet paper shortage, but at epic scale.

That said, it‚Äôs obv not a long-term issue."

@itsALLrisky Sounds kinda fun
@ValaAfshar OG Smartwatch
"@WorldofTesla1 Yeah, new Model S &amp; X have PS5 level entertainment computing power"
@DocumentingBTC Nice
@jeremyjudkins @Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Agreed
"@Model3Owners Making this work has been / still is super difficult, but it‚Äôs a revolution in car body design &amp; production ‚Äì lighter, tighter, better NVH, higher precision, lower capex, lower unit cost"
"@Ryanth3nerd @Tesla Moving lumbar was removed only in front passenger seat of 3/Y (obv not there in rear seats). Logs showed almost no usage. Not worth cost/mass for everyone when almost never used.

Prices increasing due to major supply chain price pressure industry-wide. Raw materials especially."
"@ErcXspace @SpaceX @NASASpaceflight @MarcusHouse Pretty close. Inner ring is closer to center 3, as all 12 gimbal together. Boost back burn efficiency is greatly improved in this config."

"@OwenSparks_ @SHillforVegas @boringcompany @LVCVA Sick burn haha. Hopefully, next year."
"Model S Plaid delivery pushed to June 10. Needs one more week of tweak.
